# Race-prediction

Introduction

This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes detailed information on horse races and individual horses from 1990 to 2020. Given the complexity and inherent unpredictability of horse racing, this project seeks to explore various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two main types of files:

Races Dataset: Information on races for each year from 1990 to 2020.

Horses Dataset: Details on individual horses for each year from 1990 to 2020.

Forward Data (forward.csv): Contains information collected prior to race starts, including:

Average odds from Oddschecker.com

Current RPR and TR values


Project Goals

Primary Goal

Predict the outcome of horse races (e.g., win or place).

Secondary Goals

Identify significant features affecting race outcomes.

Explore the imbalanced nature of the dataset and develop techniques to handle it.

Create a robust prediction model using historical data.

Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.

Normalize data where necessary (e.g., times, distances).

Convert categorical variables to numerical representations (e.g., encoding country codes, race conditions).

Feature Engineering

Create new features based on existing data (e.g., performance metrics from past races).

Aggregate features across multiple races to capture trends.

Data Integration

Merge race and horse datasets on rid to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics of key features.

Distribution plots of continuous variables.

Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

Feature importance analysis using mutual information and other techniques.

Visualization

Scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to visualize data distribution.

Heatmaps for correlation visualization.

Modeling Approach

Model Selection

Evaluate various machine learning models, such as:

Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks

Use cross-validation to assess model performance.

Handling Imbalanced Data

Techniques such as:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

Under-sampling

Class weight adjustments

Feature Selection

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

Regularization techniques to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Perform grid search and random search for optimal hyperparameters.
